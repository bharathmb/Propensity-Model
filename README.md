User friendly end-to-end automated tool which helps in solving the binary classification problems using Machine learning algorithms.

The tool also performs preprocessing and data cleaning on the dataset which is a prerequisite before modelling.

The tool also makes use of the opensource feature selection package HYBRIDFS in R along with an analysis module to look at important features in the dataset using univariate/bivariate plots.

Modelling the problem is now easy with the tool which provides options to use algorithms such as Logistic Regression, RandomForest, Naive-Bayes and SVM.

The tool also allows Scoring new datasets in the future using the models created .
